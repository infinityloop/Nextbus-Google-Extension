					<p>A native Chinese, Kelvin spent his early years in the shadows casted down from the concrete jungles of Hong Kong. He would then migrate
							to the last piece of land untouched by civilized hands: Canada. While not building igloos or being chased down by polar bears, Kelvin can be found
							palely lit by the glow of computer monitors as he beats back the Zerg invasion or team killing in a friendly game of Counter Strike. 
					</p>		
					<p>	As he grew into his late teens, Kelvin also develops his Zombie Apocalypse survival skills training in 
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iaido">Iaido</a> and diving from cover to cover in a game of paintball. He finds 
							solace in reading George R.R. Martin or fishing by a pond on a warm summer's day with a cigar at hand. In the dead of winter (which is like all the time in Canada), Kelvin 
							would be shredding down the man-made snow of Ontario while secretly dreaming of the glorious mountains of British Columbia.
					</p>
					<p>At the end of the day, Kelvin wants what any guy his age wants: Happiness, adventure, and one of those nitrogen-cooled Peta-Flop super computers.
							He's just a simple guy with a simple dream. Maybe when he gets there, he can lay down and rest on a sacred Japanese mountain and meditate his days away. 
							Or maybe he'll just fish and smoke cigars some more, who knows? One thing's for certain, Kelvin will not rest until he has smited all of this enemies and achieved all that he desires. (/cliche)

					<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
					<img class="aboutImageLeft" src="/images/KelvinLauGrad.jpg" height="299px" width="200px"></img>
					<p> Kelvin Lau began his Post-Secondary education as a Political Science major. After just a single semester in, Kelvin realized
							that his passion did not lie with arguing about perspectives all day, but in fact with tinkering with bits and bytes. With an ironclad
							determination and a little bit of help from his friends, this arts major would tackle mathematics, algorithmic processes,
							and thousands of lines of code to emerge as a graduate from  
							<a href="http://uoguelph.ca">University of Guelph</a> with a Bachelor of Computing with Honours.<br/></p>
							
					<p>	Soon after graduating, Riot Games would descend on this newly hatched graduate and introduce him to the world of game production.
							Kelvin would soon discover the world of Agile process, production methods, and project accountability. As Riot Games got bigger and bigger,
							resources became scarce and Kelvin would find himself in a sea of chaos with no guide to lead him the shore. Rather than having Kelvin languish
							and struggle with the bounded mysteries of production, Riot Games decided that it would be best if Kelvin returned to the calmer seas of software development 
							and hone his skills back in the frozen wasteland of Canada. Perhaps Kelvin would return to sunny California to join the elite cadre of Rioters again one day. Until then, he will
							wear his Riot sweater with pride and return to smithing code within the hottest of processors.<br/></p>

				<h2>Photography</h2>
				<img class="aboutImageRight" src="/images/KelvinLau5.jpg" height="299px" width="200px"></img>
				<p>Kelvin became an unlikely amateur photographer when he first borrowed Chad Chabot's Canon 40D to go on a shooting trip with his friends. 
						Having made fun of Chad and the awesome pictures his camera takes for him, Kelvin returns home to find that the camera does not in fact make the photographer.
						Shamed and defeated by his underexposed wreck of a photo library, Kelvin decided that he would take it up as a hobby because well, why the hell not.
						After scouring Craigslist for minutes, Kelvin will go on to impulse buy his first DSLR camera: a Canon Rebel T2i. Armed with a new camera, Kelvin would return
						to the streets of Guelph to terrorize/photographer strangers and strange signs. Kelvin's goal is that one day he will be good enough that he can blame his equipment for faulty photos
						and not his professional eye (it's never the camera's fault).</p> 
				
				<p>Dogs seem to have a natural affinity to Kelvin's Camera as they seem to strike the handsomest of poses when Kelvin looks through the viewfinder. People also seems to
						be a favorite of Kelvin's subject. While he seems to do well with willing subjects, other photos captured turn out to be awkward and unflattering. If Kelvin catches K-9's at their best
						then he inevitable catches people at their worst; such as the dreaded mid sentence candids or the double chins. </p>
